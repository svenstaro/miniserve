**For when you really just want to serve some files over HTTP right now!**

**miniserve** is a small, self-contained cross-platform CLI tool that allows you to just grab the binary and serve some file(s) via HTTP.
Sometimes this is just a more practical and quick way than doing things properly.

## How to use

### Serve a directory:

    miniserve linux-distro-collection/

### Serve a single file:

    miniserve linux-distro.iso

### Set a custom index file to serve instead of a file listing:

    miniserve --index test.html

### Serve an SPA (Single Page Application) so that non-existent paths are forwarded to the SPA's router instead

    miniserve --spa --index index.html

### Require username/password:

    miniserve --auth joe:123 unreleased-linux-distros/

### Require username/password as hash:

    pw=$(echo -n "123" | sha256sum | cut -f 1 -d ' ')
    miniserve --auth joe:sha256:$pw unreleased-linux-distros/

### Generate random 6-hexdigit URL:

    miniserve -i 192.168.0.1 --random-route /tmp
    # Serving path /private/tmp at http://192.168.0.1/c789b6

### Bind to multiple interfaces:

    miniserve -i 192.168.0.1 -i 10.13.37.10 -i ::1 /tmp/myshare

### Start with TLS:

    miniserve --tls-cert my.cert --tls-key my.key /tmp/myshare

### Upload a file using `curl`:

    # in one terminal
    miniserve -u -- .
    # in another terminal
    curl -F "path=@$FILE" http://localhost:8080/upload\?path\=/

(where `$FILE` is the path to the file. This uses miniserve's default port of 8080)

Note that for uploading, we have to use `--` to disambiguate the argument to `-u`.
This is because `-u` can also take a path (or multiple). If a path argument to `-u` is given,
uploading will only be possible to the provided paths as opposed to every path.

Another effect of this is that you can't just combine flags like this `-uv` when `-u` is used. In
this example, you'd need to use `-u -v`.

### Create a directory using `curl`:

    # in one terminal
    miniserve --upload-files --mkdir .
    # in another terminal
    curl -F "mkdir=$DIR_NAME" http://localhost:8080/upload\?path=\/

(where `$DIR_NAME` is the name of the directory. This uses miniserve's default port of 8080.)

### Take pictures and upload them from smartphones:

    miniserve -u -m image -q

This uses the `--media-type` option, which sends a hint for the expected media type to the browser.
Some mobile browsers like Firefox on Android will offer to open the camera app when seeing this.

### Listen on a unix domain socket

    miniserve -p /tmp/web.socket

You can test access to this socket using curl: `curl -X GET --unix-socket /tmp/web.socket http:/localhost/index.html`

## Features

- Easy to use
- Just works: Correct MIME types handling out of the box
- Single binary drop-in with no extra dependencies required
- Authentication support with username and password (and hashed password)
- Mega fast and highly parallel (thanks to [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) and [Actix](https://actix.rs/))
- Folder download (compressed on the fly as `.tar.gz` or `.zip`)
- File uploading
- Directory creation
- Pretty themes (with light and dark theme support)
- Scan QR code for quick access
- Shell completions
- Sane and secure defaults
- TLS (for supported architectures)
- Supports README.md rendering like on GitHub

## Usage

    For when you really just want to serve some files over HTTP right now!

    Usage: miniserve [OPTIONS] [PATH]

    Arguments:
      [PATH]
              Which path to serve

    Options:
      -v, --verbose
              Be verbose, includes emitting access logs

          --index <INDEX>
              The name of a directory index file to serve, like "index.html"

              Normally, when miniserve serves a directory, it creates a listing for that
              directory. However, if a directory contains this file, miniserve will serve that
              file instead.

          --spa
              Activate SPA (Single Page Application) mode

              This will cause the file given by --index to be served for all non-existing file
              paths. In effect, this will serve the index file whenever a 404 would otherwise
              occur in order to allow the SPA router to handle the request instead.

              Port to use

              joe:sha256:a665a45920422f9d417e4867efdc4fb8a04a1f3fff1fa07e998e86f7f7a27ae3)

## How to install

<a href="https://repology.org/project/miniserve/versions"><img align="right" src="https://repology.org/badge/vertical-allrepos/miniserve.svg" alt="Packaging status"></a>

**On Linux**: Download `miniserve-linux` from [the releases page](https://github.com/svenstaro/miniserve/releases) and run

    chmod +x miniserve-linux
    ./miniserve-linux

Alternatively, if you are on **Arch Linux**, you can do

    pacman -S miniserve

On [Termux](https://termux.com/)

    pkg install miniserve

**On OSX**: Download `miniserve-osx` from [the releases page](https://github.com/svenstaro/miniserve/releases) and run

    chmod +x miniserve-osx
    ./miniserve-osx

Alternatively install with [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/):

    brew install miniserve
    miniserve

**On Windows**: Download `miniserve-win.exe` from [the releases page](https://github.com/svenstaro/miniserve/releases) and run

    miniserve-win.exe

Alternatively install with [Scoop](https://scoop.sh/):

    scoop install miniserve

**With Cargo**: Make sure you have a recent version of Rust. Then you can run

    cargo install --locked miniserve
    miniserve

**With Docker:** Make sure the Docker daemon is running and then run

    docker run -v /tmp:/tmp -p 8080:8080 --rm -it docker.io/svenstaro/miniserve /tmp

**With Podman:** Just run

    podman run -v /tmp:/tmp -p 8080:8080 --rm -it docker.io/svenstaro/miniserve /tmp

## Shell completions

If you'd like to make use of the built-in shell completion support, you need to run `miniserve
--print-completions <your-shell>` and put the completions in the correct place for your shell. A
few examples with common paths are provided below:

    # For bash
    miniserve --print-completions bash > ~/.local/share/bash-completion/completions/miniserve
    # For zsh
    miniserve --print-completions zsh > /usr/local/share/zsh/site-functions/_miniserve
    # For fish
    miniserve --print-completions fish > ~/.config/fish/completions/miniserve.fish

## systemd

A hardened systemd-compatible unit file can be found in `packaging/miniserve@.service`. You could
install this to `/etc/systemd/system/miniserve@.service` and start and enable `miniserve` as a
daemon on a specific serve path `/my/serve/path` like this:

    systemctl enable --now miniserve@-my-serve-path

Keep in mind that you'll have to use `systemd-escape` to properly escape a path for this usage.

In case you want to customize the particular flags that miniserve launches with, you can use

    systemctl edit miniserve@-my-serve-path

and set the `[Service]` part in the resulting `override.conf` file. For instance:

    [Service]
    ExecStart=/usr/bin/miniserve --enable-tar --enable-zip --no-symlinks --verbose -i ::1 -p 1234 --title hello --color-scheme monokai --color-scheme-dark monokai -- %I

Make sure to leave the `%I` at the very end in place or the wrong path might be served. You
might additionally have to override `IPAddressAllow` and `IPAddressDeny` if you plan on making
miniserve directly available on a public interface.

## Binding behavior

For convenience reasons, miniserve will try to bind on all interfaces by default (if no `-i` is provided).
It will also do that if explicitly provided with `-i 0.0.0.0` or `-i ::`.
In all of the aforementioned cases, it will bind on both IPv4 and IPv6.
If provided with an explicit non-default interface, it will ONLY bind to that interface.
You can provide `-i` multiple times to bind to multiple interfaces at the same time.

## Why use this over alternatives?

- darkhttpd: Not easily available on Windows and it's not as easy as download-and-go.
- Python built-in webserver: Need to have Python installed, it's low performance, and also doesn't do correct MIME type handling in some cases.
- netcat: Not as convenient to use and sending directories is [somewhat involved](https://nakkaya.com/2009/04/15/using-netcat-for-file-transfers/).

## Releasing

This is mostly a note for me on how to release this thing:

- Make sure `CHANGELOG.md` is up to date.
- `cargo release <version>`
- `cargo release --execute <version>`
- Releases will automatically be deployed by GitHub Actions.
- Update Arch package.
